# 16-frontend-projects
This repo will contain my implementaion of all the 16 projects mentioned in [this](https://dev.to/frontendmentor/16-front-end-projects-with-designs-to-help-improve-your-coding-skills-5ajl) blog.

I'll use React for all of the projects, no styling libraries. I may use Redux for any stateful components, just for learning.
